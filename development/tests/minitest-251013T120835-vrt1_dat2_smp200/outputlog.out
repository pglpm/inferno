Starting Monte Carlo sampling of 200 samples by 2 chains
in a space of 191 (effectively 258) dimensions.
Using 2 cores: 100 samples per chain, max 1 chains per core.
Requested:   ESS 100   rel.MCSE 0.099.
Core logs are being saved in individual files.
C-compiling samplers appropriate to the variates (package Nimble)
this can take tens of minutes. Please wait...
Compiled core 1. Number of samplers: 196.             
Estimating remaining time, please be patient...Sampling. Core 1 estimated end time: 2025-10-13 12:12   Core 1 finished.                                        
Sampling. Core 2 estimated end time: 2025-10-13 12:12   Core 2 finished.                                        
                                                               
Finished Monte Carlo sampling.
Highest number of Monte Carlo iterations across chains: 3600.
Highest number of used mixture components: 2.

NOTE: 2 chains were stopped before reaching required precision
in order to meet the required time constraints.

Checking test data
