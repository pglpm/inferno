CALCULATING PRIOR DISTRIBUTION
Starting Monte Carlo sampling of 3600 samples by 60 chains
in a space of 1411 (effectively 1870) dimensions.
Using 4 cores: 60 samples per chain, max 15 chains per core.
Core logs are being saved in individual files.

C-compiling samplers appropriate to the variates (package Nimble)
this can take tens of minutes. Please wait...Compiled core 1. Number of samplers: 961.
