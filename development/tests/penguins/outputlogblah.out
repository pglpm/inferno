Starting Monte Carlo sampling of 3600 samples by 60 chains
in a space of 1027 (effectively 2570) dimensions.
Using 8 cores: 60 samples per chain, max 8 chains per core.
Core logs are being saved in individual files.

C-compiling samplers appropriate to the variates (package Nimble)
this can take tens of minutes. Please wait...Compiled core 1. Number of samplers: 1052.
