# Bayesian nonparametric population inference
This repository contains mathematical background and code for Bayesian nonparametric inference under exchangeability.

The R functions depeloped here aspire to become an R package soon.

A more detailed explanation and an instruction manual will be posted as soon as possible. Feel free to take a look at the [draft on the theoretical foundation](https://github.com/pglpm/bayes_nonparametric_inference/blob/main/manual/optimal_predictor_machine.pdf). A concrete example application, in medicine, is given in [this paper](https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/8nr56).

For a low-level course on Bayesian nonparametric population inference see [Foundations of data science](https://pglpm.github.io/ADA511/).
