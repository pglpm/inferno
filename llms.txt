# inferno: ***infer***ence in ***R*** with Bayesian ***no***nparametrics

![Ensemble of
densities](https://github.com/pglpm/inferno/raw/main/development/manual/inferno_symbol.png)

This repository provides an R package and some theoretical background
for *Bayesian nonparametric population inference*, which can also be
called “inference under exchangeability” or “density inference”. The
package is especially apt for the study of statistics and associations
of subpopulations or subgroups. The [introductory
vignette](https://pglpm.github.io/inferno/articles/inferno_start.html)
explains with an example the main ideas and functions, in particular for
researchers who are more familiar with traditional “frequentist”
statistics but would like to try the Bayesian approach; see the
[post](https://www.apadivisions.org/division-7/publications/newsletters/developmental/2018/07/bayesian-statistics)
by Barbara W. Sarnecka, frequentist statistician turned Bayesian, for a
brilliant overview of the Bayesian advantages.

The package is under development and has not yet reached a stable phase:
function names and arguments may still change, new functions will be
added. More tutorials will be prepared. Also the package name is still
under consideration.

But the core functionalities do work, and have been tested in concrete
research questions; see [example applications](#example-applications)
below.

The package internally does the computations necessary for Bayesian
inference by means of Monte Carlo methods, thanks to the R package
[**Nimble**](https://r-nimble.org/). Users unfamiliar with Monte Carlo
methods don’t have to worry, because the computations are handled
automatically. Users familiar with Monte Carlo methods can easily have
access to computational details and can even change some of the
computation hyperparameters.

If you want to test the package we’d be very happy to help in resolving
possible issues and in understanding the functionalities.

## Installation

You need to have the package [**Nimble**](https://r-nimble.org/)
installed. Please follow its [installation
instructions](https://r-nimble.org/manual/cha-installing-nimble.html)
for your operating system.

You can then install **inferno** in R by using the `remotes` package:

    remotes::install_github('pglpm/inferno')

To install a tagged version:

    remotes::install_github('pglpm/inferno@vx.y.z')

To install from source, first clone the repo:

    git clone https://github.com/pglpm/inferno.git

then install the package in R:

    install.packages(pkgs='path/to/inferno', repos=NULL)

the installation will also automatically install all required
R-dependencies.

## Documentation

The vignette [*Bayesian nonparametric inference with
**inferno***](https://pglpm.github.io/inferno/articles/inferno_start.html)
is a step-by-step introduction to **inferno** and also to Bayesian
nonparametrics. It guides you through a concrete example with various
kinds of inferences. You may also try to follow it using a dataset of
your own.

Other tutorials, still drafts, are available at
[pglpm.github.io/inferno](https://pglpm.github.io/inferno)

A summary of the theoretical foundations, including further references,
is available in [this
draft](https://github.com/pglpm/inferno/raw/main/development/manual/optimal_predictor_machine.pdf).
The main idea for the internal mathematical representation comes from
[Dunson &
Bhattacharya](https://doi.org/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199694587.003.0005)
and [Ishwaran & Zarepour](https://doi.org/10.2307/3315951).

For a low-level course on Bayesian nonparametric inference and Decision
Theory see [Foundations of data
science](https://pglpm.github.io/ADA511).

## *inferno* App

An application has been built upon ***inferno***. This app can be used
for testing out the features of ***inferno*** with just a few button
clicks, without having to write any code in R yourself.

### Desktop Application

- Currently available for Windows and MacOS. Download and install the
  desktop application by following this: [Installation
  Guide](https://github.com/h587916/Inferno-App/releases/tag/1.0.2).

### Cross-Platform Open Source Version

- For Windows, macOS, and Linux, you can run the PySide6 app locally
  using Python by following this: [Setup
  Guide](https://github.com/h587916/Inferno-App?tab=readme-ov-file#inferno-app).
